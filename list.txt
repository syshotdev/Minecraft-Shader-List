WARNING: I HAVE NOT DONE TESTS. THESE ARE ALL MY OPINION AND ARE NOT VERY WELL INFORMED

Favorite shader: Photon

Photon shaders
Pros: Good colored lighting, good performance
Cons: 9001 settings to change, not being updated, old

Nostalgia shaders
Pros: Looks pretty good in daylight
Cons: Bad performance, not very good cave lighting (for mining and things)

Arc shaders
Idk

Seus shaders
Pros: Very good at testing your gpu, very realistic
Cons: Horrible performance, not for every day use

Solas shaders
Idk

Shrimple shaders
Pros: Good performance, pretty good customizability
Cons: Not very good lighting in general, not good colored lights

Vanilla+ shaders
Pros: Lightweight
Cons: Not good shaders

Rethinking Voxels shaders
Pros: Real raytracing, pretty good lighting in general
Cons: Performance about as good as seus, abismal. Colored lighting sucks

Soft Voxels Lite shaders
Pros: Raytracing (I think), looks good
Cons: Mediocre performance
